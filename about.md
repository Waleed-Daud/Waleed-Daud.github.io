I'm  **Waleed Khamies**,  a research assistant at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) under the supervision of [Liam Paull](https://liampaull.ca/), where my research focusing on developing deep learning algorithms that suitable in robotics applications scenarios. I received my master at [AMMI](https://aimsammi.org/) in Mathematics sciences/Machine learning, where I worked in interpretability of reinforcement learning framework under the supervision of [George konidaris](http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/), previously I received my bachelor degree at [UofK](https://www.uofk.edu/en) in Electrical and electronics engineering, where I worked under the supervision of [Benjamin Rosman](https://www.benjaminrosman.com/).

My research interest is reinforcement learning, where I'm interested in Interpretability and several topics. I'm your guy if you love talking about music, psychology, cognitive science and life in general. dm me if you want to chat!.
